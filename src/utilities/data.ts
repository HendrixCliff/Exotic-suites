        heading: 'Does it seem like hotel costs just go up and up? It’s true that they rise each year, sometimes significantly. Projected rates for rooms in 2025 are over 15% more than 2024. When determining which hotel has the best deal, you don’t just want to look at the nightly rate anymore. There are so many other factors to consider to help you save money, both before you book and during your stay. Here are some tips to help you make the best decision.',
        subheading: 'Look for extras.The more services your rate includes, the better the bang for your buck. You’ll want to make sure they are features you will actually use though, otherwise you’re spending more than you need to. Common extras that can save you lots are free breakfast, free Wi-Fi and kids eat free. All those bowls of fruit and free coffee and tea in the lobby are also included in your room rate, so take advantage of them during your stay.',
        subheading2: 'If the costs for transportation won’t make up the difference you’d be paying on a closer location, you can frequently get a fantastic deal this way. You could also look into staying in the university district of a city. Hotels are more affordable, cheap eateries are plentiful and public transportation is convenient.',
        subheading3: 'If your travel party is larger, a suite can cost much less than adjoining or separate rooms. They offer more space and often have bedrooms, so everyone isn’t crammed in the same small space and adults don’t have to go to bed early just so they don’t wake up their kids when their bedtime rolls around.',
        subheading4: 'Room rates for hotels that get the majority of their business from professionals drop their prices when business is slow, like weekends and holidays.',
        subheading5: 'Do you normally stay at the same hotel or use the same chain when you travel? Sign up for their rewards program. Not only can you rack up points for each stay that you can then use on upgrades and free nights in the future, but rewards members also get notified of exclusive deals that can save you a ton.',
        subheading6: 'Though room service sounds really appealing, prices for food on the menu can be twice as much as you would pay for the same food at a restaurant. Gratuity is always included in the tab and usually masked as a delivery charge. Most guests don’t know this and add a tip to the bill when the waiter brings their food.',
        subheading7: 'Though this won’t technically save you any money, corner rooms are usually a bit larger than regular rooms, which give you a better deal for your money. Once you check in, ask if one of these rooms is available. This is easier if you show up close to check-in time, but before the flood of guests show up to get their keys. You can also call ahead and request a corner room with your existing reservation.',
        subheading8: 'Anything is better than the rates for items in the mini bar. The prices are outrageous and don’t even think about trying to replace it with the same item later.',
        subheading9: 'Hotels in popular destinations regularly raise their rates on Fridays and Saturdays. In some cases, it can be as much as three times more than Sunday through Thursday nights.',

    main: 'A few things to consider before booking a flight',
    heading: 'Fuel costs are constantly fluctuating, which can make budgeting for a trip a bit difficult. Another budgeting challenge to consider is all those extra fees that airlines have started tacking onto their services. But do not let these industry trends discourage you from traveling the world and seeing its beauty for yourself! Since you can not drive to all your dream destinations, flying is the only way to go sometimes and, undeniably, the fastest. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to find the most affordable fares and also avoid paying as many extra charges as possible when you plan ahead.',
    subheading: 'Airlines put out their fare sales on Tuesday morning, making this day the best day to book a flight for less.',
    subheading2: 'Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday are the slowest days to fly, which means cheaper deals than the rest of the week. You can also find reduced rates on early morning flights, since many people do not like to get up before the sun to get to the airport. Earlier boarding times can also considerably cut down your chances of getting bumped on an overbooked flight or delayed because of other delayed flights or mechanical issues.',
    subheading3: 'Some airlines charge you to pick your seat when you book online, adding even more to the bottom line of your ticket cost. If you show up early on your travel day, you can still get suitable seats.

    subheading6: 'Airlines will charge for just about anything these days. Some have even toyed around with charging customers for using the restroom. All those extra fees can certainly add up, but there is no reason to pay them if you do not have to. Here are some tips to keep money in your wallet once you get to the airport.',
    subheading7: 'Unless you are flying internationally, its rare your flight comes with a free meal. Snacks on the plane are not cheap and almost never healthy. So do not rely on what is on the small menu and instead tuck some of your own snacks  granola bars, homemade muffins, nuts, quick snacks, fruit and trail mix all make fantastic travel foods into your bag and eat a lot better, and cheaper, than other passengers.',
    subheading8: 'Almost all airlines charge them and charge big. Why pay for your clothes to fly with you? If everyone in your travel party checks a bag, your bill can be astronomical before you ever even get to your destination. Its easy to reduce the amount of stuff you pack: Make sure all your clothing coordinates, so you can take less and still make more outfit combinations, take only two pair of shoes, plan to do a bit of laundry on your trip and bring only travel-sized toiletries.',
